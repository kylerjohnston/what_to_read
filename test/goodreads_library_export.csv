And this vein is mostly dried up, but there’s enough pyrite to fool those who are overeager to find anything. Maybe there is gold at the end of this stream, but there are more fruitful veins out there and I’m leaving this one behind. ",,,1,0

300563,7 Greeks,Guy Davenport,"Davenport, Guy",,"=""0811212882""","=""9780811212885""",3,4.42,New Directions,Paperback,242,1995,-450,2013/08/24,2013/07/30,z-2013,z-2013 (#34),read,"Obviously the writers collected in this text are significant: two thousand, in some cases almost three thousand years after their deaths they are still being read.<br/><br/>But to speak about this collection. I cannot read ancient Greek (hence why I picked this up) so I cannot speak to the quality of Davenport's translation. But it seems to be well regarded by readers on the Internet. A blurb on the back of the book, written by none other than D.S. Carne-Ross, reads, ""If you don't read Greek, read Davenport; if you do, read Davenport and learn to read Greek better."" Some heavy praise.<br/><br/>I bought this mainly for the Heraclitus selections. Every other translation of Heraclitus I found in a popular press seemed to be littered with reviews about its inconsistency with the actual Greek text. Davenport is, supposedly (via: reviewers on those reputable critical websites like Amazon.com and Goodreads), more faithful to the H-man's original text. <br/><br/>The selections of Heraclitus are strong. So are the ones of Diogenes — (not written by him, since no copies of his writings still exist, but things others say he said). My favorite lines in the book comes from him:<br/><br/>27. ""When Plato said that if I'd gone to the Sicilian court as I was invited, I wouldn't have to wash lettuce for a living, I replied that if he washed lettuce for a living he wouldn't have had to go to the Sicilian court.""<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>73. ""I pissed on the man who called me a dog. Why was he so surprised?""<br/><br/>The problem with the majority of the other selections — Sappho, Archilochos, Alkman, and Anakreon — are that they are often too fragmented to be useful. I appreciate Davenport's scholastic integrity: when a fragment of a poem is missing, he just puts empty brackets to signify it; he doesn't try to complete the line.<br/><br/>The problem is that for a huge number of these poems — maybe even the majority — they are so fragmented that they are virtually meaningless. Look at these examples from Sappho:<br/><br/>13. ""The gods [...............] tears [.......]<br/>[..............]""<br/><br/>60. ""Rose<br/>[.....]<br/>Speak<br/>[.....]<br/>Yearning<br/>[.....]<br/>Sweat.""<br/><br/>122. ""]him[<br/>[......]<br/>]becomes[""<br/><br/>These fragments are certainly interesting from a scholarly point of view; but I wonder what the point of translating them into English is? If someone is going to do a scholarly study of Sappho, why would they be reading translations of broken lines found on fragments of parchment and pottery? Wouldn't it make more sense to study the parchment, the pottery itself? These English translations are, in essence, meaningless. Look at it this way: the original Greek fragments are already broken to the point of incomprehensibility: the poem is incomplete, open-ended: it is always and forever going to remain a mystery what the ""actual"" text of poem is. The fragmented Greek poem, then, is already a shadow of its former, original self. And this shadow, this thing whose meaning is already mutated from and essentially different and distinct from the ""original,"" complete poem, is further mutated into something else, something completely different, when Davenport (or anyone for that matter) translates it into English. We are not reading Sappho: we are reading Davenport. And I don't understand the significance of reading incomprehensible fragments of Davenport. <br/><br/>But occasionally through all of the broken, senseless fragments, a complete, solid, beautiful thought is produced. And these moments really shine. Davenport can make these poets write wonderful English when he is given a complete thought to work with — I just wonder why he spent so much time translating gibberish. ",,,1,0

Sure — it can be overly sentimental for overly long stretches that seem to repeat themselves over and over again; the plot can be ridiculously improbable (the ending — my god!); and sometimes Eliot's philosophy gets a little too didactic and veers a little too close to a humanist reduction of Christian <s>love</s> <i>ressentiment</i> (in this book especially).  But there is no author who describes people and the forces that drive them better than George Eliot:  there is no author who makes me feel more pathos, more significance of my role in this strange little drama we're all enacting.  And she is outrageously <i>funny</i>.  The scenes with the Dodson sisters and their families recall Kafka at his funniest and most cutting — if Kafka had been birthed and reared in provincial 19th century England.  Nothing cheers me up like George Eliot.",,,1,0

I've been working on it since—February? March? something like that—only some seventy pages left now.  It's odd—there will be a streak of aphorisms that I love, that are brilliant—but then I'll slog through half a dozen misreadings of Freud or rants about how pretty women are vain and stupid.  I feel like I like Adorno (even in spite of his misogyny)—I feel like I would enjoy his company, and we could talk about Proust and our contempt for popular culture and the bourgeoisie.  But even when I feel like Adorno is onto something brilliant, when one of the aphorisms in this book really hits me close to home, I feel like I've already read it before, and read it said better:  really, Minima Moralia's best aphorisms are the ones in which Adorno just regurgitates, almost verbatim, Marx.  I don't feel like there's anything new that I'm getting from Adorno—and while I sympathize frequently with his cultural malaise, I just can't bring myself to read those last seventy pages:  time is limited, a precious commodity in our world of late capitalism, and I'd rather spend mine reading Marx.  At least Marx offers a way out of capitalism, of the dictatorship of the bourgeois.  I suppose that is Adorno's ""new"" contribution:  he is Marx, resigned.  The world is fucked, people:  that's all Adorno has to offer.",,,1,0
